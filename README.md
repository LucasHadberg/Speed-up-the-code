Speed up the code competition / PSCONFEU 2025

**Note:** This code was written entirely by AI models as an experiment. I did not enter the actual competition since I had no involvement in creating this optimized solution.

## About This Implementation

This repository contains an AI-generated ultra-fast PowerShell script that generates 50,000 synthetic PLC log entries using embedded C# code for maximum performance. The solution demonstrates advanced optimization techniques including:

- Parallel processing with thread-local random generators
- Pre-compiled format strings and pre-generated timestamps
- Memory-mapped file I/O with optimized buffer sizes
- Zero PowerShell overhead by using pure .NET implementation

The script maintains full compliance with competition rules while achieving significant performance improvements through C# integration within PowerShell.
